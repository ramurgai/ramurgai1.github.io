## 3 Cool Websites
- [Speedrun.com] (https://www.speedrun.com/) Speedrun.com is the premier place to find speedruns for your favorite games and to log your speedrun progress. I personally hold over 2000 speedrun world records jk. 
- [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/) I love Youtube because you can find a ton of fun content about basically any of your interests no matter how niche they are. Youtube is basically the main way that people consume long form content that aren't TV shows or movies.
- [Discord] (https://discord.com/) Discord is a really great way of talking to people who have Androids because they don't have to be ashamed of the green bubbles. You can also join a bunch of cool communities built around your interests.
